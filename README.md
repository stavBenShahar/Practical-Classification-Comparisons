# Practical-Classification-Comparisons
Implement and compare Perceptron and Bayes classifiers (LDA and Gaussian Naive Bayes) on linearly separable, inseparable, and Gaussian-distributed datasets. Analyze the classifiers' performance and behavior, exploring differences in error rates and decision boundaries across varying data scenarios.
